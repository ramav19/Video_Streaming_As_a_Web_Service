# Video-Streaming-as-a-Web-Service
This application encodes video streams from the source and sends it to a local server which decodes it and relays it to the clients. The media is sent as a continuous stream of data and is played as it arrives. The application encodes the video from Webcams and relays it to the server which in turn decodes it and displays it to the user.
Set up SQLite, Python with Flask, ffserver and ffmpeg in order to run the application.
